                      <h3>Quoted in ACHR article on AI</h3>
                      <p>
                        I was interviewed about the impact of AI on the HVAC
                        industry by the trade publication ACHR. We discussed the
                        impact of AI on marketing, sales, and how the technician
                        is the hero of the field trade service industry.

                        I cohosted a webinar to talk about XOi's first AI
                        feature ahead of its launch. We also discussed how our
                        clients could prepare for the feature and what impact it
                        could have for their technicians and business.
